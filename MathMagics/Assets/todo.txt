 - Make hitbox enabled for less time
 - Boss
 - Override EnemyMovement.Attack for boss Attack  
    - Rolls 3 tiles, doesn't come back
 - After player beats boss, advance levels.
- When boss dies, he drops the next weapon (addition), player has to pick it up

BUGS
 -enemies sometimes flip the wrong direction when moving up and down
 - Boss hitting the player permanently disables movement input

What's wrong with the boss?
- (hypothesis) he's raycasting himself when trying to move, so not moving

TODO next clas
   Make a BossGridPathFinding : GridPathFinding
      override FindPath to have this logic where we raycast
