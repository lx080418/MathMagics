1. If you kill all the enemies and theres no more enemy to listen to movement, player movement input is never turned bakc on


2. Easy Mode (just like Math Knight)

Next Steps
- Easy Mode
- "You Win" Screen
    - AFter beating level 4, a special screen appea
    - Special character that congratulates the player when winning ("You have mastered the basic 4 operations!")
        - In the very beginning of each level, talks to the player, introduces new weapon/operation
            - Player has dialogue options, for example
                - "Do you think Math is fun?" Y/N -> Leads to different dialogue
- "You Died/lose" screen
    
- New background music
- Update all/most sound effects
- Main Menu Settings
- Ready button on Main Menu visuals need fixing


- Saving players progress
    - Safe what level they've made it to, not their exact position
        - level
        - health
        - potion amount
        - weapon levels
    - When you die, you can Retry(saves weapons) or Quit(doesnt save weapons)
    - Keep black screen, but instead of unlocking a weapon, they get some amount of health restored
    


Order of Operations
1. "You Lose" Screen
2. "You Win" screen
3. New Itch build + page
4. Easy Mode + Settings Screen (volume, whatever else)
5. Sound Effects / Background music update
6. Saving (see above)
