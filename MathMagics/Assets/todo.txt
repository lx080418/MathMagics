 - Make hitbox enabled for less time
 - Boss
 - Override EnemyMovement.Attack for boss Attack  
    - Rolls 3 tiles, doesn't come back
 - After player beats boss, advance levels.
- When boss dies, he drops the next weapon (addition), player has to pick it up

BUGS
 -enemies sometimes flip the wrong direction when moving up and down
 - Boss hitting the player permanently disables movement input

What's wrong with the boss?
- (hypothesis) he's raycasting himself when trying to move, so not moving

TODO next clas
   Make a BossGridPathFinding : GridPathFinding
      override FindPath to have this logic where we raycast
      
      if (nextPosition.x > transform.position.x)
        {
            Debug.Log($"Boss moving Right {nextPosition}");
            hit = Physics2D.OverlapBox(new Vector3(nextPosition.x + 1.5f, nextPosition.y + 1f, 0), collisionBoxSize, 0f);
        }
        //Left
        else if (nextPosition.x < transform.position.x)
        {
            Debug.Log($"Boss moving Left {nextPosition}");
            hit = Physics2D.OverlapBox(new Vector3(nextPosition.x + .5f, nextPosition.y + 1f, 0), collisionBoxSize, 0f);
        }
        //Up
        else if (nextPosition.y > transform.position.y)
        {
            Debug.Log($"Boss moving Up {nextPosition}");
            hit = Physics2D.OverlapBox(new Vector3(nextPosition.x + 1, nextPosition.y + 1.5f, 0), collisionBoxSize, 0f);
        }
        //Down
        else
        {
            Debug.Log($"Boss moving Down {nextPosition}");
            hit = Physics2D.OverlapBox(new Vector3(nextPosition.x + 1, nextPosition.y +.5f, 0), collisionBoxSize, 0f);
        }


Current Issues
1. If you kill all the enemies and theres no more enemy to listen to movement, player movement input is never turned bakc on


Next Steps Oooooo

1. Make a portal appear when boss is killed
    - Boss room has a set position for where the portal spawns
    - When the player moves into the portal, instantly teleport to new level

2. Easy Mode (just like Math Knight)


3. Make animation for when you beat the level, you see the weapon unlock (woo)
